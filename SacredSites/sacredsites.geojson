        "story": "A Dreamtime story of the Three Sisters Rock (also known as Two Sisters) tells of three sisters swimming off the headland at Broken Head. <br/><br/> The youngest sister swam out and became caught in a treacherous current flowing between the rocks. Her older sisters swam to save her but were also swept out. The three of them became exhausted fighting against the current and drowned, becoming the rocks that carry their name. Bundjalung people tell this story as a warning to their children, that if they swam there, they too might drown and turn to stone.",

'King' Bobby, his son Harry, (who later inherited the title from him) and their families often hunted and camped in the area that is now part of the Broken Head Nature Reserve. There are still the remnants of a hut at Brays Beach where Lorna Bray (Harry’s granddaughter) lived for some time with her family into more recent times.",

We live just up the hill up here. And this area, we used to come for our natural food: fish and crabs and eels, in this little creek here. In the morning before the birds got here, we used to come and get prawns by our hands, because we lived naturally, and we just took what we wanted for a feed. Every day we’d come down.' – Elder Aunty Linda Vidler.",

It means ‘gully’ and refers to the natural water channels found in this forested area. Currenba is a significant place for us. <br/><br/> It was a special home base and meeting place for the Arakwal people and other tribes from the Bunjalung Nation. They camped in the beautiful Palm Valley and ate pipis, fish and other abundant sea tucker, which they caught at the Pass and Wategos inside the Bay. <br\><br\> The surviving midden and campsite at Palm Valley is the oldest of its type in the region, estimated to be approximately 1,500 years old.",

The home camp was located near the current crossroads of Lawson and Fletcher Streets in the Byron Bay CBD, not far from the site of the old Council Chambers.
